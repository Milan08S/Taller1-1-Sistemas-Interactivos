# Work 1-1 Interactive Systems

## Miguel Angel Sanchez Paez

This project is a short musical piece created in Audacity using sampling techniques, as required for the "Sistemas de Interacci√≥n" workshop. The track is an original composition that explores the vibrant sounds of Brazil, blending energetic Funk Carioca vocal chops with the organic texture of traditional percussion. The piece aims to create a dynamic and rhythmic soundscape by layering and contrasting these distinct sonic elements to produce a track of at least 30 seconds.




Justification
Our creative choice was to build a track centered on the rhythmic interplay between different Brazilian vocal styles, grounded by traditional percussion. This approach allowed us to create an original piece by fusing modern and traditional sounds.

The creative process was as follows:

Vocal Dialogue: We selected two distinct vocal samples, "Brazilian Funk Vocal Processed 2" and "Brazilian Funk Vocal Wet". Using two different vocal sources allowed us to create a 'call and response' dynamic, cutting and arranging them to form a cohesive and complex rhythmic phrase.

Rhythmic Foundation: To provide an organic contrast to the processed vocals, we incorporated a Pandeiro loop from Freesound. This traditional instrument adds a steady, authentic groove that anchors the entire piece.


Arrangement: The final arrangement in Audacity focuses on the dialogue between the two vocal tracks, which were layered over the continuous Pandeiro loop. This fusion of modern vocal chops with a traditional rhythm creates the unique sound of our track.
